# AWS Cloud Practitioner Exam Guide

The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam **(CLF-C02)** is intended for individuals who have the knowledge and skills required to effectively demonstrate a general understanding of the AWS cloud, independent of specific technical roles covered by other AWS certifications (e.g., solutions - Associate, Developer - Associate or SysOps Administrator - Associate).
This exam allows individuals to validate their AWS cloud knowledge with an industry-recognized credential.

This guide is in the works to help anyone who wants to take the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, cover it up and share some of my thoughts and ideas for those planning to take the exam.
The AWS Cloud Practitioner certification is a great entry point into the world of Amazon AWS.

Our focus is AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification, which is the gateway to others.

# What is AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification?
<details>
<summary> What is AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification? </summary>

Amazon has multiple AWS cloud certification paths.
The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification is an entry-level certification that is intended to demonstrate a basic level of Amazon AWS cloud knowledge and skills.
This exam is suitable for professionals in technical, managerial, and sales roles.

To become certified, you must pass a single exam. Amazon recommends that you have at least <b>6 months of experience</b> before taking the exam. I had no prior experience with Amazon AWS prior to studying for the exam. I, however, seek in all ways to evolve.

The Certified Cloud Practitioner certification page provides links to numerous study resources, including AWS white papers, links to book the exam, sample test questions, and more.

# The AWS services

AWS services allow access to computing resources, storage, databases and various other on-demand IT services. According to Amazon, this form of computing reduces costs, minimizes the risk of failure and maximizes business opportunities.

The AWS portal for Brazil is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pt/" alt="PT" > (https://aws.amazon.com/pt/) </a> .

It is possible to try out the main services, completely free of charge, for a period of one year. More information about this free trial is found on this page: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/en/free/" alt="https://aws.amazon.com/en/free/"> https://aws.amazon.com/pt/free/ </a>.

The AWS Cloud is present in 190 countries across 13 geographic regions, 35 Availability Zones, and over 50 local points of presence. Figure 05 shows this global scope, and it is possible to observe where Amazon's Data Centers are located.

AWS customers are companies such as Netflix, Dropbox, Airbnb and Spotify. They all turned into computing giants using the services provided by Amazon's Data Centers.

AWS has a very vast set of products and services from different categories (processing, network, development, database, etc.), as we can see in the Figure Below.

# Some techniques that help in the improvement of Learning:

According to <b>Beatriz Oliveira</b> in her title article:

# How I Prepared for the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification
Available at: <a href="https://medium.com/sysadminas/como-me-preparei-para-a-certifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-aws-cloud-pratictioner-358d37fb9c60" alt="Article Beatriz Oliveira"> (https://medium.com/sysadminas/como-me-preparei-para-a-certifica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-aws-cloud-pratictioner-358d37fb9c60) </a>


In this article, she reports tips for those who want to get this certification, which I am currently following:

If you already have some experience with AWS, dedicate at least 1 hour a day for about 3 months to study, I believe this is a nice period to study calmly for the test. Amazon recommends this certification for those who have at least 6 months of experience, so I believe that following this recommendation to prepare is very interesting.

Follow the preparation guide available on the AWS website.
<a href="https://d1.awsstatic.com/training-and-certification/docs-cloud-practitioner/AWS-Certified-Cloud-Practitioner_Exam-Guide.pdf"> Preparation Guide </a>

Take free simulations, like the one available on the whizlabs website.
<a href="https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/">https://www.whizlabs.com/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/</a>

If you can, take the practice exam available on the AWS website
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/en/certification/certification-prep/"> https://aws.amazon.com/en/certification/certification-prep/ </a>.

Create an account on the AWS website to familiarize yourself with the interface and services while studying.

# Other means I'm using too:
1. Creating Mind Maps. <br/>
2. Specific Books (Subject) and Questions. <br/>
3. Creation of a database of questions about the specific Certification. <br/>
4. Project-Based Learning<br/>
5. Problem-Based Learning<br/>
6. Search youtube classes on the subject. <br/>

#1. Creating Mind Maps.

The mindmaps for AWS services to get AWS Certificates easier. For Vietnamese, you can see the study guide [here](http://notcuder.com/toi-da-lay-chung-chi-aws-solutions-architect-associate-nhu-the-nao/)

Those images are designed with [xmind tool](http://www.xmind.net)

# 3. Creation of a database of questions about the specific Certification.

<a href="https://www.awslagi.com/practice-questions/" alt="practice-questions">practice-questions</a><br/>
Accessed on: Aug. of 2021.<br/>
It has several questions for training, in the case of AWS Cloud Practitioner, the site has 3 Quiz and 6 Pdfs, with the questions.

# 6. Look for classes on youtube on the subject.
